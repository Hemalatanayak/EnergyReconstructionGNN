## GNN-Based Muon Energy Reconstruction for INO-ICAL

This project employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to reconstruct the energy of muons in the proposed India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO-ICAL) experiment. More detailed information can be found in the following [link](https://inspirehep.net/files/dc2f5519333c1a76f8834e7ad411d60b).

The graph dataset used for this project has already been prepared and is available in this [repository](https://github.com/Hemalatanayak/ical_graph_data).

The dataset was simulated using ICAL, and the source code for the simulation is accessible [here](https://github.com/Hemalatanayak/ical_g4).

The notebook contains the code for performing energy classification using a Graph Neural Network (GNN).
