## GNN-Based Muon Energy Reconstruction for INO-ICAL

This project utilizes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to reconstruct the energy of muons for the proposed India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO-ICAL) experiment. For more detailed information, please refer to the following [link](https://inspirehep.net/files/dc2f5519333c1a76f8834e7ad411d60b).

The graph dataset for this has been already prepared and can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/Hemalatanayak/ical_graph_data).
